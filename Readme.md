# Binary Search Tree Implementation

A clean and efficient implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in [language].

## Overview

A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, with the following properties:
- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the parent node
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the parent node
- Both left and right subtrees are also binary search trees

## Features

- Insert nodes
- Delete nodes
- Search for values
- Traverse the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Find minimum and maximum values
- Check if the tree is balanced
- Get tree height

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Insert    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
