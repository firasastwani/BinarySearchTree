# Binary Search Tree Implementation

A clean and efficient implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Java.


## Features

- Insert nodes
- Delete nodes
- Search for values
- Traverse the tree 
- Find minimum and maximum values
- Retrieve nodes
- Get single parents
- Get the number of leaf nodes
- Get the cousins of an inputted node

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Insert    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
